#Verifies if two propositions are equivalent.\
On the actual version, its only possible to see the truth table of one proposition at time.

How to use:
run equivalence.py, a input will show up, on it write your logical proposition, like "x V y", and it will print the truth table after all the combinations avaiable for the variables.
\
Logical operator:\
"^" = and.\
"V" = or.\
"¬" = not.\
">" = inplicates.\
\
Variable names:\
 -Any digit that can be represented on Unicode and isn't "V", "^", ">", "¬", "(" and ")" is a valid variable. 
 -The variable names are case sensitive, so "X" isn't the same as "x"

Brackets:
 -Propositions between "(" and ")" are calculate first.
